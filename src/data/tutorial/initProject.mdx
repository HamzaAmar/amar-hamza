# What is Node

> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

# Prerequisites

1. Here's what you need to have in order to follow along:

2. A code editor installed (psst- VS Code is ideal)
   An existing codebase (if you need to get setup, you can follow "How to Setup a TypeScript + Node.js Project first and then come back to this article)

# Installation and setup

Run the following commands to setup ESLint in your TypeScript project.

```
npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

Create an `.eslintrc` file.

In it, use the following starter config.

```
{
  "root": true,
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": [
    "@typescript-eslint"
  ],
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ]
}
```

# Ignoring files we don't want to lint

Create an `.eslintignore` in order to prevent ESLint from linting stuff we don't want it to.

```
touch .eslintignore
```
