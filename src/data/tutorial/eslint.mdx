# Intro

Linting is one of the best tools that can help you and your team make a cleaner code also prevent you from a lot of _programming errors_ and save a lot of your time (programming errors mean more debugging time) but for me, what I like about linting more then make my code clean and prevent me from a certain type of error. It also helps me know new stuff that I think is going to take a lot of time to get to know them. When I see lint errors, I get happy because it means new stuff to learn.

# Prerequisites

1. Here's what you need to have in order to follow along:

2. A code editor installed (psst- VS Code is ideal)
   An existing codebase (if you need to get setup, you can follow "How to Setup a TypeScript + Node.js Project first and then come back to this article)

# Installation and setup

Run the following commands to setup ESLint in your TypeScript project.

```
npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

Create an `.eslintrc` file.

In it, use the following starter config.

```
{
  "root": true,
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": [
    "@typescript-eslint"
  ],
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ]
}
```

# Ignoring files we don't want to lint

Create an `.eslintignore` in order to prevent ESLint from linting stuff we don't want it to.

```
touch .eslintignore
```
