    description: `My journey as a web developer began when I decided to transition from PHP to Node.js, with the goal of becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer. I recognized the importance of focusing my time and efforts on a single language and ecosystem, and decided to start with JavaScript as the foundation of my skillset. From there, I delved into Node.js, which allowed me to build scalable and efficient backend systems using JavaScript. Finally, I discovered my passion for React, which allowed me to build dynamic and interactive front-end applications using the same language and principles. Throughout this journey, I have constantly challenged myself to learn and grow, and am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills as a developer.`,

I temporarily stopped freelancing to solidify my knowledge of CSS, Git, and accessibility. To my surprise, I found that I was enjoying this process immensely and fell in love with this stack. I discovered that I was happiest when discovering new things and improving my skills in these areas. Since then, I have continued working in the same field, and have continued to find joy in exploring new ways to improve my CSS skills and create beautiful and accessible user interfaces.`,
