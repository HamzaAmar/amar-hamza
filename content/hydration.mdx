Welcome back! In our previous post, we discussed Client-Side Rendering. Today, we'll explore Hydration, a technique that enhances the performance of Single Page Applications by combining the benefits of Server-Side Rendering and Client-Side Rendering. Hydration involves rendering the initial HTML on the server and then "hydrating" it on the client side with JavaScript to make it interactive.

    Hello, I'm interested in learning about Server-Side Rendering
    (SSR). I've come across the term hydration, but I'm not quite sure
    what it means. Could you explain it to me ?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
    Imagine an artist who creates a black and white sketch. This
    sketch is like the server-rendered HTML sent to the browser.
    Hydration is when the artist starts to paint over the sketch,
    adding colors and details to make the drawing vibrant and
    interactive. This process attaches the necessary JavaScript to the
    static HTML, enabling interactions and dynamic behavior just like
    adding colors brings the sketch to life.

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Mmm, that sounds good! But how does that relate to websites? ðŸ¤”
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    OK let me explain! my role as the server is to render your
    application's components into a fully formed HTML document. This
    is then transmitted to the browser, ensuring a faster initial page
    load (Note that hydration, the process of making the page
    interactive, is handled by the browser, not the server).
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    Exactly! Once I receive that HTML, I show it to the user right
    away. But, this initial version is static, kind of like a picture.
    Hydration is where I come in to make it interactive.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    So, hydration is what makes the page interactive?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    You got it! Hydration is a process that happens on the client-side
    (that's me, the browser!). I run the JavaScript code that came
    along with the HTML. This code does things like attach event
    listeners so you can click on buttons, make dynamic updates, and
    add application state. Basically, it turns a static page into a
    fully interactive web app.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Hmm. How is hydration different from isomorphic rendering?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    Isomorphic rendering (also called universal rendering) consists of
    two phases: server-side rendering, which delivers initial content
    quickly, and client-side hydration, which makes the rendered
    content interactive. this means that hydration is part of the
    isomorphic rendering.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    That's much clearer now. Are there any potential issues that can
    arise during hydration?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    Good question! Hydration relies on the server and client being the
    same. If there are any inconsistencies between the server-rendered
    HTML and what the client-side JavaScript expects, it can cause
    errors.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    That makes sense. But what's the drawback of hydration?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    <div>
      **Slow Time to Interactive**: Hydration can slow down how
      quickly a page becomes interactive (TTI) because the browser
      needs to download and run all the JavaScript code that makes the
      page interactive.{' '}
    </div>
    <div>
      **Duplicate Execution**: The same app logic might need to run
      twice â€“ first on the server to generate the initial HTML, and
      then again in the browser during hydration to add interactivity.
    </div>
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Ah, I see. Is there a way to solve this problem?

    Thank you for the detailed explanation. I have a much better
    understanding of hydration and its importance in Isomorphic
    rendering now.

We hope you now have a better understanding of Hydration and its role in modern web development. Join us next time as we delve into [Static Site Generation (SSG)](/blogs/server-side-rendering), a method that pre-renders pages at build time for optimal performance. Goodbye for now, and see you in our next post on Static Site Generation!
