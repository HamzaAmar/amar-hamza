In our previous post, we introduced the concept of rendering patterns. Today, we'll delve into Static Sites, a fundamental approach to web rendering. Static sites are pre-rendered and delivered to the user as simple HTML files, ensuring fast load times and minimal server load.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

<Conversation>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">Hey Chat, I've been hearing a lot about static websites lately. Can you explain what they are?</Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">I’ll start. A static website is a collection of HTML documents that I store and deliver to you, whenever you request a page. These HTML files have the same content for everyone and don’t change based on who is viewing them.</Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">When you visit a static site, I simply display the HTML file that Server provides. It’s straightforward because there’s no need for additional processing or generating content on the fly.</Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">I see. But why would someone choose a static website?</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Content is Unchanging: If your site’s content doesn’t need
    frequent updates or personalization.
  </div>
  <div>
    Performance is Key: Static sites load faster since Server just
    delivers files without running extra code.
  </div>
  <div>
    Cost is a Concern: Hosting is cheaper because static sites use
    fewer resources.
  </div>
  <div>
    Simplicity is Desired: They’re easy to create and maintain.

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  What are the main pros of using a static site?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Speed: Static sites are fast because they don’t need to generate
    content on the server or make database calls. The server simply
    sends you the files you requested, which means fewer delays.
  </div>
  <div>
    Security: Since there’s no server-side code execution, there are
    fewer vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers, making
    static sites more secure.
  </div>
  <div>
    Cost-Effective: Lower hosting costs since they require less
    processing power.
  </div>
  <div>
    SEO Friendly: Static websites tend to be favored by search engines
    for several reasons. Their simple HTML structure allows for
    efficient crawling and indexing of content, ensuring that all
    relevant information is readily accessible to search engines.
    Moreover, static sites usually load faster than dynamic ones,
    which is a known ranking factor in search engine algorithms. This
    speed advantage can lead to improved visibility in search results.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  What about the cons?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Full Page Reloads: Navigating from one page to another requires
    reloading the entire page.
  </div>
  <div>
    Limited Interactivity: Not great for dynamic content or user
    interactions without additional client-side coding.
  </div>
  <div>
    Management Complexity: Maintaining a large static site can be
    tedious and error-prone.
  </div>
  <div>
    Design Rigidity: Changing the layout or design requires manual
    updates to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  What if the files that the server sends are too big? Could it cause
  rendering problems for the browser? How can I solve this problem?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    Absolutely, large files can slow down the loading time and affect
    the user experience. Here are some strategies to mitigate this:
  </div>
  <div>
    Optimize Images: Use tools to compress images without losing
    quality, and consider using modern formats like WebP.
  </div>
  <div>
    Minify Code: Reduce the size of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    files by removing unnecessary characters, comments, and
    whitespace.
  </div>
  <div>
    Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images and other media,
    so they load only when they are needed.
  </div>
  <div>
    Enable Compression: Use server-side compression methods like Gzip
    or Brotli to reduce the size of files sent to the browser.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="cdn">
  <div>
    Use a CDN: Distribute your content through a Content Delivery
    Network (CDN) to ensure faster delivery of your files globally.
    CDNs cache your content in multiple locations around the world, so
    users can load your site from the server closest to them, reducing
    latency and improving load times.

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  How do you go about building a static website?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>You need only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</div>
  <div>Or a framework like 11ty, Hugo, Jekyll</div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Thanks, Chat! This was really helpful. Any final thoughts?
