In our previous post, we introduced the concept of rendering patterns. Today, we'll delve into Static Sites, a fundamental approach to web rendering. Static sites are pre-rendered and delivered to the user as simple HTML files, ensuring fast load times and minimal server load.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

    Hey Chat, I've been hearing a lot about static websites lately.
    Can you explain what they are? 🤔
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
    <div>
      Think of a static website like a food truck parked on a busy
      street. 🚚 The menu is fixed, and all the dishes are prepared in
      advance. You walk up, look at the options displayed on the side
      of the truck, and pick what you want. It's fast, convenient, and
      exactly what you see is what you get.
    </div>
    <div>
      A static website is similar. The content is already laid out and
      ready to go. You browse the pages, see what's on offer, and
      choose what interests you. It's a straightforward, no-frills way
      to get the information you need.
    </div>
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    I’ll start. A static website is a collection of HTML documents
    that I store and deliver to you, whenever you request a page.
    These HTML files have the same content for everyone and don’t
    change based on who is viewing them. 📄
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    When you visit a static site, I simply display the HTML file that
    Server provides. It’s straightforward because there’s no need for
    additional processing or generating content on the fly. ⚡
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    I see. But why would someone choose a static website? 🤷‍♀️
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    <div>
      Content is Unchanging: If your site’s content doesn’t need
      frequent updates or personalization. 📰
    </div>
    <div>
      Performance is Key: Static sites load faster since Server just
      delivers files without running extra code. 🚀
    </div>
    <div>
      Cost is a Concern: Hosting is cheaper because static sites use
      fewer resources. 💰
    </div>
    <div>
      Simplicity is Desired: They’re easy to create and maintain. 😌
    </div>
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    What are the main pros of using a static site? 👍
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    <div>
      Speed: Static sites are fast because they don’t need to generate
      content on the server or make database calls. The server simply
      sends you the files you requested, which means fewer delays. ⚡
    </div>
    <div>
      Security: Since there’s no server-side code execution, there are
      fewer vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers, making
      static sites more secure. 🛡️
    </div>
    <div>
      Cost-Effective: Lower hosting costs since they require less
      processing power. 💵
    </div>
    <div>
      Static websites are SEO-friendly due to their simple structure
      and fast loading times. Search engines easily crawl and index
      their content, leading to better visibility in search results.

    What about the cons? 👎
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    <div>
      Full Page Reloads: Navigating from one page to another requires
      reloading the entire page. 🔄
    </div>
    <div>
      Limited Interactivity: Not great for dynamic content or user
      interactions without additional client-side coding. 😐
    </div>
    <div>
      Management Complexity: Maintaining a large static site can be
      tedious and error-prone. 🤯
    </div>
    <div>
      Design Rigidity: Changing the layout or design requires manual
      updates to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 🛠️
    </div>
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    What if the files that the server sends are too big? Could it
    cause rendering problems for the browser? How can I solve this
    problem? 😥
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    <div>
      Absolutely, large files can slow down the loading time and
      affect the user experience. Here are some strategies to mitigate
      this: 👇
    </div>
    <div>
      Optimize Images: Use tools to compress images without losing
      quality, and consider using modern formats like WebP. 🖼️
    </div>
    <div>
      Minify Code: Reduce the size of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      files by removing unnecessary characters, comments, and
      whitespace. 🧹
    </div>
    <div>
      Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images and other media,
      so they load only when they are needed. 😴
    </div>
    <div>
      Enable Compression: Use server-side compression methods like
      Gzip or Brotli to reduce the size of files sent to the browser.
      🗜️

  <Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
    I see this is our first time encountering a CDN. Let me explain it
    to you! Imagine a chain of food trucks, each a replica of the
    original, stationed strategically across a bustling city. The same
    delicious sandwich is available at every location, but the closest
    truck to your neighborhood serves you. 🚚💨 No matter where you
    are, you get the same sandwich, delivered quickly and efficiently.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="cdn">
    <div>
      Use a CDN: Distribute your content through a Content Delivery
      Network (CDN) to ensure faster delivery of your files globally.
      CDNs cache your content in multiple locations around the world,
      so users can load your site from the server closest to them,
      reducing latency and improving load times. 🌐

    How do you go about building a static website? 🏗️
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    <div>You need only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 💪</div>
    <div>Or a framework like 11ty, Hugo, Jekyll 🧰</div>

    Thanks, Chat! This was really helpful. Any final thoughts? 😊
