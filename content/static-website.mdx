Rendering patterns is one of the crucial concepts for a frontend web developer as it helps in creating fast, responsive, and effective web applications. In the same way that there are various styles of baking a cake, there are also different types of rendering patterns that can affect the usability, speed, and SEO of a website.

Each of the rendering patterns has certain features, strengths and weaknesses, and therefore, you should select the proper pattern regarding the requirements of your project. When it comes to rendering patterns, you should think of them as different strategies by which your web browser understands the code that underlies your website and how users will interact with it.

This is the first in a series of blogs where I will be discussing different rendering patterns, why they are required, when one should be used over the other and the advantages and disadvantages of each pattern. We will first discuss the basics of web rendering, like static web samples and then move to complex ones like SSR, CSR, hydration, progressive hydration, partial hydration, server components, etc.

Thus, by knowing each of the rendering patterns, you will be in a position to decide on the right technique to apply in a certain project. Regardless of whether concerns include speed, UX, or SEO, this series will give you a clear understanding of rendering patterns so that you can ensure your users get the best experience possible on the web.

Let's dive in with the first pattern: Static Website.
