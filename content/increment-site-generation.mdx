In our last post, we covered Server-Side Rendering. Today, we'll delve into Incremental Site Generation (ISG), a technique that builds upon Static Site Generation by allowing pages to be generated or updated incrementally after the initial build. ISG ensures that your site remains fast and up-to-date without needing a full rebuild for every change.

Thank you for joining us in exploring Incremental Site Generation. In our next post, we'll discuss Progressive Hydration, a technique that optimizes the hydration process for improved performance and user experience. Goodbye for now, and see you in our next discussion on Progressive Hydration!
