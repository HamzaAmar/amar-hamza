## Introduction

When writing CSS code, it's important to prioritize readability and maintainability. Clean and maintainable CSS code
helps ensure that your styles are easy to understand, modify, and scale over time. This can save you time and effort
in the long run, as well as improve the user experience of your website or application. By following best practices
for organizing, naming, and commenting your CSS code, you can create a more efficient and effective workflow for yourself
and your team.

## Structuring your CSS files

When it comes to structuring your CSS files, there are several approaches you can take. The best file structure for you will depend on the size and complexity of your project, as well as your personal preferences. Here are some common CSS file structures you can consider:

- **Single file**: In this structure, all CSS styles are contained within a single file. This is a simple approach and works well for small projects or projects with limited styles.

- **Modular structure**: In this structure, CSS is divided into modules or components, each with its own file. This allows for greater organization and easier maintenance, as changes can be made to specific modules without affecting the rest of the styles. For example, you could have a separate file for your header styles, footer styles, and so on.

- [**SMACSS**](https://www.toptal.com/css/smacss-scalable-modular-architecture-css): SMACSS stands for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS. It's a methodology for organizing your CSS code, which is based on the concept of separating your styles into five categories: base, layout, module, state, and theme. Each category has its own file, making it easy to find and update specific styles.

-[ **ITCSS**](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/): is a methodology that focuses on organizing CSS code based on its specificity and its place in the cascade. It uses a structure that is shaped like an inverted triangle, with broad, global styles at the top, followed by more specific and contextual styles as you move down the triangle.
Regardless of the file structure you choose, it's important to keep your code organized and maintainable. Use comments to label different sections of your code and avoid nesting your styles too deeply, which can make your code difficult to read and update.

But in this section I will teach you how to benifits from first we need to structure ower css files into 8 files every one contain the code needed in this folder

- settings: file contain the theme for the project more info below

```css title="scss/_settings.scss" {2,5}
:root {
  --primary-color: red;
  --small-size: 2rem;
  --zindex-sm: 2;
  /* ...etc */
}
```

- tools: it's only needed if you are using scss for mixing and functions
- generics: contain reset and global styles

```css title="scss/_generics.scss"
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
ul,
ol,
dl,
p {
  margin: 0;
}

input,
select,
textarea {
  font: inherit;
}
```

- layout:

```css title="scss/_layouts.scss"
.l_cluster {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: var(--cluster-gap, 1rem);
  justify-content: var(--cluster-justify, flex-start);
  align-items: var(--cluster-align, flex-start);
}

.l_flow > * + * {
  margin-top: var(--flow-gap, 1em);
}
```

- components: contain all component style and in here I use bem naming convention to prevent naming collision
  this is an example ulstrate what i do

```scss title="components/core/button/_button.scss"
.btn {
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 1rem;
}

.btn__solid {
  background: hsl(0, 60%, 60%);
  color: white;
}

.btn--icon {
  --size: 1em;
}
// ...etc
```

```scss title="components/common/footer/_footer.scss"
.footer {
  display: flex;
}

.footer--subscribe {
  background: red;
}
// ...etc
```

```scss title="scss/_components.scss"
@forward '../../../components/core/button/button';
@forward '../../../components/common/footer/footer';
// ...etc
```

- utilities: contain all utility style you use from the project better prefix it with u\_

```css title="scss/_utilities.scss" hello='world'
/* VISUALLY HIDDEN UTILITY */

.u_sr-only {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 0;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
/* ...etc */
```

## Using CSS Variables and creating a theme

CSS variables, or custom properties, allow you to define reusable values that can be used throughout your CSS code. You can create a set of variables for your theme colors, font sizes, spacing, and more. By using variables, you can easily change the look and feel of your website by updating just a few values, instead of searching and changing individual styles throughout your code.

To create a CSS variable, use the following syntax:
Here's an example of how to use CSS variables to create a theme and how to access this variables

```css showLineNumbers {2,6}
:root {
  --variable-name: value;
}
/* OR any css selector */
.button {
  --variable-name: value;
}
```

To use a CSS variable, you can reference it by calling var() function and passing the variable name:

```css showLineNumbers {2}
.button {
  background-color: var(--variable-name);
}
```

You can also overwrite the value of a CSS variable by redefining it on a specific element or a scope. This can be useful when implementing different themes for your website or by using a specific selector to define variables for a particular element or scope. Scoped variables can be inherited by the element's children, allowing for more efficient and concise code. For example:

```css showLineNumbers title="main.css"
:root {
  --primary-color: blue;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  color: var(--color);
}

.button__solid {
  --primary-color: hsl(0, 80%, 70%);
  --color: white;
}
.button__soft {
  --primary-color: hsl(0, 50%, 50%);
  --color: hsl(0, 80%, 70%);
}
.button--outine {
  --primary-color: hsl(0, 20%, 20%);
  --color: hsl(0, 80%, 70%);
}
```

## Use meaningful class names

Use descriptive class names that accurately reflect the function of the element. This makes it easier to understand the
purpose of the styles and find specific styles when making modifications.

One way to use meaningful class names and organize your CSS code is by using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.
BEM is a naming convention that helps you create maintainable, scalable, and reusable CSS code.

In BEM, a "block" is a standalone component on the page, such as a navigation bar or a form. An "element" is a part
of the block that has its own function and cannot be used outside of the block, such as a button or a form input.
A "modifier" is a variation of the block or element that changes its appearance or behavior, such as a disabled button
or a highlighted menu item.

here I am gonna give two examples first one is a button component and the second is a navigation menu

```jsx showLineNumbers title="button.tsx" {33, 37, 39,40}
import React from 'react';
import type {
  ReactElement,
  ReactNode,
  ButtonHTMLAttributes,
} from 'react';

//  This is Typescipt code for people how does not understant typescript you can scape this interface

interface ButtonProps
  extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant: 'solid' | 'outline' | 'soft';
  color: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger' | 'success' | 'warning';
  children: ReactNode;
  icon: ReactElement;
}

/*
 In this example we need to show you what is block , element , modifier
 - The block: is the button how own everything
 - The element: is the other element inside the block in that case the icon and skeleton you need to prefix the with the
    block followed by --
 - The modifier: some element or the block sometimes has defferent look
*/

const button = ({
  variant,
  color,
  children,
  icon,
  ...rest
}: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={`btn btn__${color} btn__${variant}`}
      type="button"
      {...rest}
    >
      <span className="btn--icon btn--icon__left">{icon}</span>
      <span>{children}</span>
      <span className="btn--icon btn--icon__right">{icon}</span>
      <span className="btn--skeleton" />
    </button>
  );
};

export default button;
```

## How to write Dry CSS

To write dry CSS, you should follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, which means avoiding duplication of code as much as possible. Here are some tips on how to write dry CSS:

- Use Global theme (font,space , color) we already speak about it above
- Use CSS inheritance to avoid repeating the same properties across multiple selectors.

```css
.text {
  font-size: 1rem;
  color: red;
}
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Don't do
const contact = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <span className="text">{icon}</span>
      <span className="text">{icon}</span>
      <span className="text" />
    </div>
  );
};

// DO
const contact = () => {
  return (
    <div className="text">
      <span>hello</span>
      <span>hello</span>
      <span />
    </div>
  );
};

export default contact;
```

Another example if you use some css properties that not inherited by default like border-radius or background-color

```css
.avatar {
  width: 2rem;
  height: 2rem;
}

.avatar--fallback {
  border-radius: inherit;
}

/*  Don't DO */

/*
 .avatar--fallback {
  border-radius: 50%;
  } 
*/
```

because what if we have multi avatar corner Variant let say that we have

```ts
/*
  sharp: border-radius:0;
  sm: border-radius:4px;
  md: border-radius:8px;
  lg: border-radius:16px;
  circle: border-radius:50%;
  rounded: border-radius:1000px;
*/
interface avatar {
  corner: 'sharp' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'circle' | 'rounded';
}
```
