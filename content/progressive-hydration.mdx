Welcome back! In our previous post, we discussed Incremental Site Generation. Today, we'll explore Progressive Hydration, an advanced technique that optimizes the process of making a server-rendered page interactive. Instead of hydrating the entire page at once, Progressive Hydration gradually hydrates portions of the page as needed, enhancing performance and user experience.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

Hey Chat, can you tell me about Progressive Hydration? 🤔
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
 <div>
Imagine an artist creating a massive mural. Instead of painting it all at once, it's time consuming process that would make viewers  wait, they strategically begin with the sections that will immediately catch the viewer's eye. As people walk along the mural, the artist progressively adds more color and detail, guiding the viewer's gaze and unfolding the artwork's story piece by piece.
</div>
<div>
 Progressive hydration works similarly: initially, only the visible parts of the web page are fully 
 painted (hydrated). As the user scrolls or interacts with the page, additional sections are 
 progressively hydrated, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience.

Mmm, that sounds good! But how does that relate to websites? 🤔
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Okay, let me explain! My role as the server is to take your application's components and turn them into a complete HTML document. Then, I send that document to the browser so it can start making the page interactive.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
<div>Exactly! Once I receive the HTML, I immediately display it to the user. However, this initial version is not interactive. I prioritize making the essential parts of the page interactive first and then handle the rest as the user interacts with them.</div>
<div>For example, on an e-commerce product details page, we prioritize making the most essential elements interactive as soon as possible. This includes things like image carousels and the "Buy" button. The reviews section, typically located further down the page, is made interactive only when you scroll to it. This strategy improves the Time to Interactive (TTI) metric, leading to a faster and smoother user experience.</div>

  <div>
    So, Progressive Hydration aims to optimize the Time to Interactive
    (TTI)? ⏱️
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Exactly! By loading only essential JavaScript first and the rest
    progressively, the page becomes usable faster, which improves the
    TTI and overall user experience. 🚀
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  So, what are the main advantages of using Progressive Hydration?
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    **User Experience**: Interactivity is added progressively,
    improving the Time to Interactive metric 🎨
  </div>
  <div>
    **SEO**: Like SSG, the static content is easily crawlable by
    search engines, improving SEO. 📈
  </div>
  <div>
    **Flexibility**: Allows developers to prioritize which parts of
    the page should become interactive . 🔄
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Are there any challenges or downsides to using Progressive
  Hydration?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    **Limitations**: Not suitable for highly dynamic apps where all
    elements need to be interactive are in the viewport, such as chat
    applications.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Complexity**: Implementing Progressive Hydration can be more
    complex compared to traditional Hydration. It requires careful
    planning of when and how to hydrate parts of the page. 🧩
  </div>
  <div>
    **JavaScript Management**: Ensuring efficient loading and
    execution of JavaScript can be challenging. Overloading the page
    with too much JavaScript can negate the performance benefits. 🚧
  </div>
  <div>
    **Duplicate Execution**: The same app logic might need to run
    twice – first on the server to generate the initial HTML, and then
    again in the browser during hydration to add interactivity.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  How can I start implementing Progressive Hydration in my projects?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Here are some steps to get you started:

  <div>1. **Choose a Framework**: Use frameworks that support Progressive Hydration, like Next.js or Gatsby. 🛠️</div>
  <div>2. **Identify Critical Parts**: Determine which parts of your page need to be interactive immediately and which can wait. 🎯</div>
  <div>3. **Load JavaScript Progressively**: Ensure that your JavaScript is loaded in chunks, prioritizing critical parts first. 🗂️</div>

  You're welcome! 😊 Progressive Hydration is a powerful technique
  that balances performance and user experience. By delivering static
  content first and progressively adding interactivity, you can create
  fast, engaging, and SEO-friendly websites. Don't forget to
  experiment and test thoroughly to get the best results. Stay tuned
