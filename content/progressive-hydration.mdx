Welcome back! In our previous post, we discussed Incremental Site Generation. Today, we'll explore Progressive Hydration, an advanced technique that optimizes the process of making a server-rendered page interactive. Instead of hydrating the entire page at once, Progressive Hydration gradually hydrates portions of the page as needed, enhancing performance and user experience.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

    Hey Chat, can you explain what Progressive Hydration is?
  </Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  Progressive Hydration is a technique to make web pages interactive
  faster. It does this by sending only the essential JavaScript needed
  for the first load, then loading the rest bit by bit.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  How is the remaining JavaScript handled?
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  The rest of the JavaScript is downloaded and executed gradually,
  often when the user interacts with the page or specific elements
  become visible. This way, the initial load is faster, improving the
  user's experience.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Can you give an example using an e-commerce website?
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  Sure! Think of a product detail page. Initially, the server sends
  the HTML and basic JavaScript needed for the page to load and be
  interactive, excluding non-critical parts like customer reviews.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  As the user scrolls down the page, the JavaScript for the customer
  reviews section is loaded. This allows users to interact with
  ratings and filters without waiting for everything to load all at
  once.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  So, Progressive Hydration aims to optimize the Time to Interactive
  (TTI)?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  Exactly! By loading only essential JavaScript first and the rest
  progressively, the page becomes usable faster, which improves the
  TTI and overall user experience.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  What are the pros of using Progressive Hydration?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>Faster initial load times</div>
  <div>Better user experience on slower networks</div>
  <div>Reduced Time to Interactive (TTI)</div>
  <div>Efficient use of server resources</div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  What are the cons of using Progressive Hydration?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>More complex to implement</div>
  <div>
    Requires careful planning for which parts of the page to load
    first
  </div>
  <div>May need monitoring and adjustments over time</div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Thanks, Server and Browser! This really clarifies how Progressive
  Hydration can boost performance. Any final thoughts?
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  Progressive Hydration is a great way to improve web performance and
  user experience. By planning and implementing it carefully, you can
  ensure your site loads quickly and smoothly.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  Stay tuned for our next conversation where weâ€™ll dive into more
  advanced rendering techniques and performance optimizations. See you
  next time!
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Looking forward to it!
