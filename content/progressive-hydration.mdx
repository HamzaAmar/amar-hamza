Welcome back! In our previous post, we discussed Incremental Site Generation. Today, we'll explore Progressive Hydration, an advanced technique that optimizes the process of making a server-rendered page interactive. Instead of hydrating the entire page at once, Progressive Hydration gradually hydrates portions of the page as needed, enhancing performance and user experience.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

Hey Chat, can you tell me about Progressive Hydration? 🤔
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
Think of a large theater production. When the curtains open, you immediately see the stage set up with beautiful scenery. 🌟 As the play progresses, actors come in one by one, adding life and movement to the scene. This gradual introduction keeps the audience engaged and makes the experience more enjoyable.

Progressive Hydration works in a similar way. Initially, your web page is rendered statically, like the stage scenery. Then, JavaScript is loaded progressively, enhancing different parts of the page with interactivity as needed, like actors entering the stage. This method ensures a fast initial load and a smooth, engaging user experience. 📜➡️🎭

  That sounds interesting! How does it compare to other rendering
  techniques like SSG or SSR?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Great question! Here's a quick comparison:

  <div>**SSG (Static Site Generation)**: Pre-renders the entire website into static HTML at build time. It's super fast but lacks interactivity until JavaScript loads. ⚡</div>
  <div>**SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Renders the web page on the server for each request. It provides a fully interactive page immediately but can be slower due to server processing. 🖥️</div>
  <div>**Progressive Hydration**: Combines the best of both worlds by delivering a static page initially and progressively adding interactivity. It ensures quick initial load times and a smooth user experience. 🚀</div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
So, what are the main advantages of using Progressive Hydration?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Here's why Progressive Hydration is beneficial:

  <div>**Performance**: Initial load times are fast because the page is served statically at first. 🏎️</div>
  <div>**User Experience**: Interactivity is added progressively, providing a seamless and engaging experience. 🎨</div>
  <div>**SEO**: Like SSG, the static content is easily crawlable by search engines, improving SEO. 📈</div>
  <div>**Flexibility**: Allows developers to prioritize which parts of the page should become interactive first. 🔄</div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
Are there any challenges or downsides to using Progressive Hydration?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Yes, there are a few to consider:

  <div>**Complexity**: Implementing Progressive Hydration can be more complex compared to traditional SSG or SSR. It requires careful planning of when and how to hydrate parts of the page. 🧩</div>
  <div>**JavaScript Management**: Ensuring efficient loading and execution of JavaScript can be challenging. Overloading the page with too much JavaScript can negate the performance benefits. 🚧</div>
  <div>**Testing**: Ensuring that both the static content and the interactive elements work seamlessly together can require extensive testing. 🔍</div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
How can I start implementing Progressive Hydration in my projects?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Here are some steps to get you started:

  <div>1. **Choose a Framework**: Use frameworks that support Progressive Hydration, like Next.js or Gatsby. 🛠️</div>
  <div>2. **Identify Critical Parts**: Determine which parts of your page need to be interactive immediately and which can wait. 🎯</div>
  <div>3. **Load JavaScript Progressively**: Ensure that your JavaScript is loaded in chunks, prioritizing critical parts first. 🗂️</div>
  <div>4. **Optimize for Performance**: Use techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and caching to enhance performance. 🚀</div>

    Hey Chat, can you explain what Progressive Hydration is? 🤔

    Progressive Hydration is a nifty trick to make web pages
    interactive faster. 🎩✨ It sends only the essential JavaScript
    needed for the first load, then loads the rest bit by bit. Like
    serving the appetizers before the main course!
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  <div>How is the remaining JavaScript handled? 🧐</div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    The rest of the JavaScript is downloaded and executed gradually,
    often when you start interacting with the page or when specific
    elements come into view. It’s like a movie that loads just the
    first few scenes first so you can start watching ASAP. 🎬

  <div>Can you give an example using an e-commerce website? 🛒</div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Sure thing! Imagine a product detail page. Initially, the server
    sends the HTML and basic JavaScript needed for the page to load
    and be interactive, excluding non-critical parts like customer
    reviews. 🏷️
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    As you scroll down, the JavaScript for the customer reviews
    section loads. This way, you can interact with ratings and filters
    without waiting for everything to load at once. It’s like
    unwrapping a gift in stages! 🎁

  <div>
    So, Progressive Hydration aims to optimize the Time to Interactive
    (TTI)? ⏱️
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Exactly! By loading only essential JavaScript first and the rest
    progressively, the page becomes usable faster, which improves the
    TTI and overall user experience. 🚀
