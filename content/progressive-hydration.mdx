Welcome back! In our previous post, we discussed Incremental Site Generation. Today, we'll explore Progressive Hydration, an advanced technique that optimizes the process of making a server-rendered page interactive. Instead of hydrating the entire page at once, Progressive Hydration gradually hydrates portions of the page as needed, enhancing performance and user experience.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

    Hey Chat, can you explain what Progressive Hydration is? 🤔

    Progressive Hydration is a nifty trick to make web pages
    interactive faster. 🎩✨ It sends only the essential JavaScript
    needed for the first load, then loads the rest bit by bit. Like
    serving the appetizers before the main course!

  <div>How is the remaining JavaScript handled? 🧐</div>
</Conversation.Thread>

  <div>
    The rest of the JavaScript is downloaded and executed gradually,
    often when you start interacting with the page or when specific
    elements come into view. It’s like a movie that loads just the
    first few scenes first so you can start watching ASAP. 🎬

    Sure thing! Imagine a product detail page. Initially, the server
    sends the HTML and basic JavaScript needed for the page to load
    and be interactive, excluding non-critical parts like customer
    reviews. 🏷️
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    As you scroll down, the JavaScript for the customer reviews
    section loads. This way, you can interact with ratings and filters
    without waiting for everything to load at once. It’s like
    unwrapping a gift in stages! 🎁

    So, Progressive Hydration aims to optimize the Time to Interactive
    (TTI)? ⏱️
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Exactly! By loading only essential JavaScript first and the rest
    progressively, the page becomes usable faster, which improves the
    TTI and overall user experience. 🚀

  <div>What are the pros of using Progressive Hydration? 😊</div>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>- Faster initial load times 🏃‍♂️</div>
  <div>- Better user experience on slower networks 🌐</div>
  <div>- Reduced Time to Interactive (TTI) ⌛</div>
  <div>- Efficient use of server resources 💾</div>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>- More complex to implement 🤯</div>
  <div>
    - Requires careful planning for which parts of the page to load

    Thanks, Server and Browser! This really clarifies how Progressive
    Hydration can boost performance. Any final thoughts? 👍
