In our previous article, we discussed Island Architecture. Today, we shift our focus to React Server Components. This paradigm allows developers to render specific components exclusively on the server side, optimizing overall application performance and simplifying data fetching.

  Hey Chat, could you explain **React Server Components** in simple
  terms, assuming I have no idea about **rendering patterns**? ü§î

  <div>
    Imagine your web app as a restaurant experience. The server, like
    the head chef, prepares all the dishes in the kitchen. Some
    dishes, like a salad, are fully prepared in the kitchen and ready
    to be enjoyed as is (server components). Others, like a burger,
    are mostly prepared in the kitchen but require a final touch at
    the your table perhaps a melted cheese added by the waiter to
    complete the perfect meal (client component).

  Mmm, that sounds interesting! Could you explain a real-world example
  using ss, showing the step by step process of how the server and
  browser work together to make this happen? ü§î

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    As a server, my primary function is to generate the initial HTML
    structure of a web page. However, this process involves two
    distinct component types: server components and client components
  </div>
  <div>
    **Server components:** I render these entirely on the server,
    generating their HTML output. No JavaScript code is sent to the
    client, eliminating the need for hydration.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Client components:** on the other hand, are rendered by me but
    also include JavaScript code that is sent to the browser (for
    application state, event handlers, and access to DOM nodes). This
    allows the browser to hydrate these components, enabling
    interactive features and dynamic updates within the web page.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  Thanks for explaining, server! My role as the browser becomes more
  streamlined. I receive the generated HTML from the server and
  display it to the user. Since the heavy lifting is done server
  component, I have less JavaScript to parse and execute, leading to
  faster Time to interact (TTI).
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Thanks for the explanation. I understand that client components are
  the traditional components we use, which render on the server and
  hydrate on the client. However, I'm still a bit confused about
  server components. Could you provide some examples to help me
  understand them better?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Okay, let's simplify it: Server Components run exclusively on the
    server. Let me give you an example to illustrate this...
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a component that displays the date in the format
    (YYYY.MM.DD). With traditional client components, we'd send the
    raw date and JavaScript code to the browser to hydrate it. Server
    components, however, allow us to format the date directly on the
    server and send only the formatted result in HTML, simplifying the
    process and reducing client-side load.

  What are the main benefits of using React Server Components?

</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">

  <div> **Optimize Data Fetching:** Fetch data within Server Components to keep the data-fetching logic close to where it's used.</div>
  <div>
    **Improved Performance:** Fetching and caching data within server
    components can significantly improve performance by reducing
    client-side load and optimizing response times.
  </div>
  <div>
    **SEO-Friendly:** Server-rendered HTML is more easily indexed by
    search engines, improving SEO.
  </div>
  <div>
   Improved User Experience: Since server components do not hydrate on the client, the client's bundle size is reduced, improving the application's Time To Interact (TTI).
  </div>
  <div>
    **Simplified Codebase:** Server Components can handle data
    fetching directly, simplifying the data handling logic and
    reducing the need for complex client-side state management.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Improved Security:** Server components enhance security by
    keeping sensitive data out of reach from the client.

  What are the cons of using React Server Components?

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    **New paradigm**: Introducing a new approach that requires a
    learning curve.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Limited Adoption**: Not all packages are currently compatible
    with Server Components. This new paradigm requires further
    integration across the ecosystem.

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  When should you opt for a client component instead of a server
  component?
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    In general, you should aim to use Server Components whenever
    possible. They reduce the JavaScript bundle size, improve
    performance, and simplify data fetching. However, there are
    specific scenarios where Client Components become necessary:
  </div>
  <div>
    **Managing State**: If your component needs to maintain and update
    its own internal state, a Client Component is required.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Leveraging Effects**: To perform side effects like subscribing
    to external events or running code when a component mounts or
    unmounts, you'll need a Client Component. Server Components do not
    have a lifecycle for managing these types of operations.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Interacting with Browser APIs**: When your component needs to
    interact directly with browser APIs (e.g., accessing geolocation,
    or working with local storage), a Client Component is necessary.
    These APIs aren't available on the server.
  </div>
  <div>
    **manipulating the DOM**: If your component needs to directly
    interact with the DOM (e.g., for focusing an input, measuring
    dimensions, applying animations, or handling click events), you'll
    need to use a Client Component. Server Components don't have
    access to the browser's DOM.

  I'm really liking this React Server Components Pattern! I'm curious,
  though, are there any potential performance issues I should be aware
  of?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Absolutely! While server components offer many benefits, there are
    some potential performance considerations to keep in mind.
  </div>
  <div>One such consideration is larger file sizes.</div>
  <div>
    Additionally, time-consuming data fetching can slow down the
    page's First Contentful Paint (FCP).
  </div>
  <div>
    Furthermore, increased server load due to rendering components can
    also impact performance, especially under heavy traffic.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  <div>
    That makes sense. So, what can I do to prevent this performance
    issues?
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    Certainly! There are several effective strategies for optimizing
    the performance of Server Components.
  </div>
  <div>
    To enhance site size performance, you can implement techniques
    outlined in this guide: [Static Site
    Enhancement.](/blogs/static-website#static-site-enhancement)
  </div>
  <div>
    For the issue of slow loading page sections due to database calls
    or other processes, we can leverage
    [Streaming](/blogs/streaming-server-side-rendering) to ensure that
    the rest of your page content is displayed promptly without being
    held back by slower components.
  </div>
  <div>
    [Leveraging caching mechanisms on both the server and
    client-side](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching)
    can significantly reduce server load and improve overall
    performance.

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Thanks Chat ! This helps a lot. Any final tips?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  You're welcome! Remember that Server Components can significantly
  enhance the performance and user experience of your web
  applications. Use them strategically to offload work from the client
  to the server, and combine them with Client Components for
  interactivity. Keep experimenting and monitoring your application‚Äôs
  performance to get the best results.
