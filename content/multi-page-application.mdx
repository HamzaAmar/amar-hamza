Welcome back! Last time, we discussed Static Sites. Today, we'll look into Multi-Page Applications (MPAs), which involve multiple web pages, each reloading entirely when navigated. MPAs are traditional but still widely used in many web applications for their simplicity and straightforward navigation.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

<Conversation>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">Hey Chat, can you tell me about Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)?</Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">Sure! An MPA is a traditional approach where each page of the application is a separate document. When you ask for a page, I generate it in the background before sending it to Browser. This generation process can take some time, which makes MPAs slower than the static sites we discussed earlier.</Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">When the server sends me the HTML for a new page, I process it and create a visual representation on your screen based on the instructions in the code.</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  
  When you navigate to a different section, the entire page reloads. This
  is because the server is responsible for handling the routing logic and
  generating the HTML content for each page. When you click a link, the
  server receives the request, determines the appropriate page to display,
  and then sends the fully rendered HTML back to your browser.

  When should I use an MPA?

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  What are the pros of MPAs?
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    SEO Benefits: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) ensures that search
    engines can index your content effectively.
  </div>
  <div>
    Improved Performance: Initial load times are generally faster as I
    send a fully rendered HTML document, but not as fast as static
    sites because I need to generate the HTML on the fly.
  </div>
  <div>
    Security: Sensitive data handling and validation can be managed
    more securely on my end.
  </div>
  <div>
    Better User Experience: Users get a fully-loaded page quickly,
    improving the overall user experience.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  And what about the cons?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    Full Page Reloads: Navigating from one page to another requires
    reloading the entire page.
  </div>
  <div>
    Server Load: SSR can put a significant load on the server,
    especially for high-traffic sites.
  </div>
  <div>
    Complexity: Developing and maintaining MPAs can be more complex
    compared to static sites or
    [SPAs](/blogs/client-side-rendering-dynamic-user-experiences)
  </div>
  <div>
    Scalability: Scaling an SSR-based application can be challenging
    and might require more server resources and optimization.

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">What frameworks can I use to build an MPA?</Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    <div>Ruby on Rails</div>
    <div>Django</div>
    <div>Laravel</div>
    <div>ASP.NET Core</div>

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Thanks, Chat! This was really insightful. Any final thoughts?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    Multi-Page Applications offer a powerful way to build dynamic, SEO-friendly web applications with fast initial load times and secure data handling. While they come with their own set of challenges, the benefits often outweigh the complexities for many use cases.

    Stay tuned for our next conversation where weâ€™ll explore [Client-Side Rendering (CSR)](/blogs/client-side-rendering-dynamic-user-experiences) and understand how it differs from SSR, along with its advantages and disadvantages!
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Looking forward to it!

Thanks for exploring Multi-Page Applications with us. In our next post,
we'll discuss [Client-Side Rendering](/blogs/client-side-rendering-dynamic-user-experiences), a technique that offers a more interactive
user experience. Goodbye, and see you next time as we dive into Client-Side
Rendering!
