Welcome back! Last time, we discussed Static Sites. Today, we'll look into Multi-Page Applications (MPAs), which involve multiple web pages, each reloading entirely when navigated. MPAs are traditional but still widely used in many web applications for their simplicity and straightforward navigation.

  <Conversation.Thread
    message="Sure! An MPA is a traditional approach where each page of the application is a separate document. When you click on a link or navigate to a different section, the entire page reloads from me where I pre-generate the HTML content for each page before sending it to Browser. This makes MPAs load faster initially and can be beneficial for SEO."

Thanks for exploring Multi-Page Applications with us. In our next post, we'll discuss Client-Side Rendering, a technique that offers a more interactive user experience. Goodbye, and see you next time as we dive into Client-Side Rendering!
