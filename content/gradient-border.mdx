## How to Create Border Gradients in CSS

**Introduction:**
Border gradients can add depth and visual appeal to elements on your webpage. In this guide, we'll explore different methods to achieve border gradients using CSS.

### Understanding Gradients in CSS

Gradients in CSS allow for smooth transitions between two or more colors. There are three main types of gradients:

- **Linear Gradient**: Fades from one color to another along a straight line.
- **Radial Gradient**: Fades from one color to another in a circular pattern.
- **Conic Gradient**: Fades from one color to another in a conical pattern.

You can learn more about gradients in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient).

### Using `border-image` Property

The `border-image` property in CSS enables us to replace the border styles with an image, allowing for more flexibility in border design. However, it comes with certain limitations, such as the inability to add rounded corners to the element.

```css
.btn--gradient-border {
  border-width: 0.5rem;
  border-image: linear-gradient(to right, pink, blue) 1;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}
```

This snippet demonstrates how to apply a gradient border using the `border-image` property. However, keep in mind the mentioned limitations when using this approach.

### Creating Border Gradients with Background Property

An alternative method involves using the `background` property to create border gradients. This approach allows for more flexibility and customization.

```css
.btn--gradient-border {
  border: 0.5rem solid transparent;
  background: linear-gradient(
        var(--primary-color),
        var(--primary-color)
      ) padding-box, linear-gradient(
        90deg,
        var(--primary-color),
        var(--primary-color)
      ) border-box;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}
```

By leveraging the `background` property, we can achieve gradient borders without the limitations of the `border-image` property.

### Conclusion

Border gradients offer a creative way to enhance the visual appeal of elements on your webpage. By leveraging CSS properties like `border-image` and `background`, you can achieve stunning effects and elevate your design.
