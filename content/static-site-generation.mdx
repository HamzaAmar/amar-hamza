In our last post, we covered Hydration. Today, we'll focus on Static Site Generation (SSG), a technique that pre-renders web pages at build time, resulting in fast and secure static files. SSG combines the best of both worlds by offering the performance of static sites with the ability to fetch dynamic content at build time.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">Hey Chat, I've been hearing about SSG with Hydration. Could you explain it more simply? ü§î</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
  <div>
Imagine you're hosting a big dinner party. You prepare all the dishes in advance and wait for the guests to arrive. Once they are seated, you quickly set the table and make everything look perfect so they can start enjoying the meal right away. üçΩÔ∏è This is like Static Site Generation (SSG) ‚Äì the website content is pre-built and ready to go when users visit.
  </div>
  <div>
    Then, after you serving the main dish, you bring out the sauces,
    drinks, and final touches to make the experience even better. This
    is like hydration ‚Äì adding interactivity to the pre-built content,
    making it dynamic and responsive for the users.

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Mmm, that sounds good! But how does that relate to websites? ü§î
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  My primary responsibility is to pre-render web pages as static HTML
  files during the build process. This ensures that pages are
  available for immediate delivery when requested by the browser.
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  Once I receive the pre-rendered HTML, I display the initial page
  layout to the user. Then, I execute the JavaScript code, adding
  interactive elements and any additional content to create a dynamic
  user experience. üíª
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Those sound like good reasons. What are the main advantages of using
  SSG with hydration? üëç
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>Here's a quick overview of the pros:</div>
  <div>
    **Blazing Fast:** Like static websites, SSG with hydration loads
    incredibly quickly because the initial content is pre-generated.
    ‚ö°
  </div>
  <div>
    **Interactive:** The "hydration" process adds JavaScript, making
    the site feel like an app with interactive features. ‚ú®
  </div>
  <div>
    **Better Security:** Less server-side code means fewer
    vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. üõ°Ô∏è
  </div>
  <div>
    **SEO Friendly:** Search engines still love them because of their
    speed and simple structure. üèÜ
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="cdn">
  <div>
    And don't forget! I'm a caching whiz, making it super easy for me
    to cache your site and deliver it lightning-fast to your users,
    wherever they are. ‚ö°
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Those are some impressive advantages! But are there any downsides?
  üëé
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>Here are a few things to keep in mind: </div>
  <div>
    **Not as Dynamic:** While interactive, it's not as dynamic as a
    full-blown web application.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Build Time:** Generating all those pages upfront can take some
    time, especially for very large sites.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Content Deployment:** Updating content requires a new deployment
    of the site üõ†Ô∏è.
  </div>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  I'm really liking this SSG with hydration concept! I'm curious,
  though, are there any potential performance issues I should be aware
  of?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    Absolutely! Even with pre-rendering, if your website has big files
    like images or lots of JavaScript, it might take a bit longer to
    load, especially on slower internet.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    There are definitely ways to optimize those files! [We've covered
    some of them
    already](/blogs/static-website#static-site-enhancement), and we'll
    be discussing even more ways to improve JavaScript performance in
    a later section like [Progressive
    Hydration](/blogs/progressive-hydration) , [Server
    Components](/blogs/server-component),...etc. Stay tuned! üòâ
  </div>
  <div>And Also we can use techniques like:</div>
  <div>
    **Code Splitting**: Break down your website's code into smaller
    pieces. Only send the code needed for the current page, not
    everything at once.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Prefetching Navigation**: We can even pre-load links to other
    pages on your site, so clicking on them feels super fast.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Dynamic Imports and Lazy Loading**: This lets us load JavaScript
    modules only when they're actually needed, instead of all at once
    when the page loads.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  GOOD But I'm curious, which framework would you recommend for
  building a static site generator (SSG)?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  Here are a few popular options: **Gatsby** | **Next.js** |
  **Nuxt.js**

Thank you for joining us in exploring Static Site Generation. In our next
post, we'll discuss [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](/blogs/server-side-rendering),
a technique that renders web pages on the server at request time for a
dynamic and personalized user experience. Goodbye for now, and see you
in our next discussion on Server-Side Rendering!
