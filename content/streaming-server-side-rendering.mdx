In our last post, we covered Progressive Hydration. Today, we'll focus on Streaming Server-Side Rendering, an innovative approach that streams HTML content from the server to the client as it is being rendered. This technique reduces time-to-first-byte and improves perceived performance by allowing users to see content faster.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

  Hey Chat, can you explain what Streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
  is and how it works? 🤔
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
  <div>
    Imagine you're at a fancy restaurant and you order a multi-course
    meal. Instead of waiting for the entire meal to be prepared before
    any food is brought to your table, the chef sends out each dish as
    soon as it's ready. You start with the appetizer, then the soup,
    followed by the main course, and finally the dessert. This way,
    you start enjoying your meal right away without waiting for
    everything to be finished.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is a game-changer.
    Instead of waiting for the entire web page to be fully generated
    before sending it to your browser, the server sends parts of the
    page as soon as they're ready. This allows you to start viewing
    and interacting with the initial content of the page while the
    rest is still being processed and sent. It's like enjoying the
    appetizer while the chef is still cooking the main course.
  </div>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Mmm, that sounds interesting! But how would that work for websites?
  🤔
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  When you ask for a page, I start building it right away. But instead
  of making you wait for the whole thing, I send you pieces as they're
  ready (fastest to slowest). This means you can see stuff on your
  screen almost instantly, even as I keep working on the rest of the
  page.
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    As I receive each chunk, I add it to the page and immediately
    hydrate it to make it interactive.So You can start exploring the
    content before the entire page has finished loading, resulting in
    a much smoother and faster browsing experience!
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Wow, that sounds like it would make websites load much faster! 🚀
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  Precisely! Since users see content earlier, the perceived load time
  is significantly reduced. Plus, streaming allows for better handling
  of slow network connections and large pages.
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  I see. What are the main benefits of using Streaming SSR? 🌟
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>Here are some key benefits: </div>
  <div>
    **performance improvement:** Streaming delivers page
    incrementally. This significantly improves perceived performance,
    especially for larger or more complex pages, by reducing Time to
    First Byte (TTFB) and allowing for faster First Paint (FP) and
    First Contentful Paint (FCP).
  </div>
  <div>
    **Selective Hydration:** Each part of the page is made interactive
    (hydrated) as soon as it arrives from the server, providing a
    seamless and responsive user experience.
  </div>
  <div>
    **SEO friendly**: Search engines love static websites because of
    their simple structure and fast loading times. 🏆
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  What are the potential challenges or considerations with Streaming
  SSR? 🤔
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Good question! Here are some challenges:

<div>
  **Complexity:** Identifying and addressing potential performance
  bottlenecks section and use it as a separate chunk that need to be
  streamed to don't slow down the page.
</div>
<div>
  **Caching:** Managing cache invalidation can be tricky, as you need
  to ensure users always get the latest content.
</div>
<div>
  **Data Consistency:** Ensuring consistent data across different
  parts of the app can be challenging, especially with asynchronous
  data fetching.
</div>

</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Interesting! Are there any frameworks that support Streaming SSR? 🛠️
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
Yes, several frameworks support Streaming SSR. Some popular ones include:

<div>
  **Next.js:** Offers built-in support for both SSR and Streaming SSR.
</div>
<div>
  **Hydrogen:** A framework by Shopify that leverages Streaming SSR
  for e-commerce sites.
</div>
<div>
  **React:** With React 18, features like Suspense for data fetching
  enhance Streaming SSR capabilities. 🌐

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Thanks, Chat! This was really helpful. Any final thoughts? 😊
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  You're welcome! Streaming SSR is a powerful technique for building
  fast, efficient web applications. By streaming content as it becomes
  available, you can significantly improve user experience and
  performance. If you're interested, next time we can dive into
  practical implementation examples. Stay tuned! 📚

Thank you for exploring Streaming Server-Side Rendering with us. In our next post, we'll discuss [Island Architecture](/blogs/island-architecture-enhancing-performance-and-interactivity), a unique rendering pattern that enhances the performance of interactive applications by isolating dynamic components. Goodbye for now, and see you in our next discussion on [Island Architecture](/blogs/island-architecture-enhancing-performance-and-interactivity)!
