Welcome back! Previously, we discussed Static Site Generation. Today, we shift our focus to Server-Side Rendering (SSR), a technique where the server generates the HTML for a page on each request. SSR enhances performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered pages to the client, improving load times and user experience.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

    Hey Chat, I'm interested in learning more about SSR with
    Hydration. Could you each explain your roles in this process?

    <div>
      Imagine you're at a fancy restaurant where the chef prepares
      each dish to order. When you place your order, the chef cooks
      the meal in the kitchen and brings it out to you, fresh and hot.
      You get to enjoy a dish that's made specifically for you at that
      moment.
    </div>
    <div>
      Once the dish is served, the waiter adds finishing touches like
      seasoning or garnishes right at your table to enhance the
      experience. adding interactivity and dynamic elements to the
      freshly served content, making it more engaging and responsive
      for the user.

    Certainly. In SSR with Hydration, my primary responsibility is to
    pre-render the initial HTML of the web page on the server-side.
    This includes fetching necessary data, executing application
    logic, and generating the complete HTML structure, which is then
    sent to the Browser.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    <div>
      Thank you, Server. As the Browser, my role is to receive that
      server-rendered HTML and immediately display it to the user.
      However, my work doesn't end there. I then utilize JavaScript to
      hydrate the static HTML. This involves attaching event
      listeners, Add Application State, ...etc, effectively transforming the static content
      into a fully interactive web application.[You can check the
      last article about Hydration for more
      details.](/blogs/hydration-combining-server-and-client-rendering)

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Why would one choose to use SSR over other rendering methods?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    It significantly improves the initial page load performance. Users can view the
    content almost instantly, as they receive a fully rendered page
    rather than waiting for JavaScript to execute and render the
    content on the client-side. 
    </div>
  <div>
      Static websites are SEO-friendly due to their simple structure
      and fast loading times. Search engines easily crawl and index
      their content, leading to better visibility in search results.
  </div>
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    Additionally, hydration allows us to maintain the benefits of
    client-side interactivity. By incrementally attaching JavaScript
    behavior to the existing HTML structure, we avoid the need for
    full page reloads, resulting in a seamless and responsive user
    experience.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Are there any potential drawbacks to this approach?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    <div>
      One challenge is ensuring that the server-rendered HTML and the
      client-side hydrated content remain in sync to avoid
      inconsistencies and errors. Careful attention to detail is
      required during implementation to mitigate this risk.
    </div>
    <div>
      Additionally, due to server-side rendering generating the HTML,
      increased server load is a potential concern, especially with a
      large number of requests or complex page structures. Balancing
      caching mechanisms and server resources is important for
      mitigating this.
    </div>
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    <div>
      Furthermore, while hydration enhances interactivity, it also
      introduces a slight overhead due to the additional JavaScript
      execution required on the client-side it can impact Time to
      Interactive (TTI).

Is there a way to reduce Time to Interactive (TTI) in this approach? It seems like there might be a delay before users can interact with the page fully.
