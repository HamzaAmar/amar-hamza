Welcome back! Previously, we discussed Static Site Generation. Today, we shift our focus to Server-Side Rendering (SSR), a technique where the server generates the HTML for a page on each request. SSR enhances performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered pages to the client, improving load times and user experience.

  Hey Chat, could you explain how Server Side Rendering(SSR) and Hydration work together in simple terms, assuming I have no idea about **rendering patterns**? ü§î
  </Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="narrator">
  <div>
    Imagine you're at a fancy restaurant where the chef prepares each
    dish to order. When you place your order, the chef cooks the meal
    in the kitchen and delivers it to you, fresh and hot. You get to
    enjoy a dish that's made specifically for you at that moment. üçΩÔ∏è
  </div>
  <div>
    Once the dish is served, the waiter adds finishing touches like
    seasoning or garnishes right at your table to enhance the
    experience. This is like hydration ‚Äì adding interactivity and
    dynamic elements to the freshly served content, making it more
    engaging and responsive for the user.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Mmm, that sounds interesting! Could you explain a real world
  example, showing the step by step process of how the server and
  browser work together to make this happen? ü§î
</Conversation.Thread>
<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  Certainly. In SSR with Hydration, my primary responsibility is to
  render the initial HTML of the web page on the server. This includes
  fetching necessary data, executing application logic, and generating
  the complete HTML structure, which is then sent to the Browser.
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>
    Thank you, Server. my role is to receive that server-rendered HTML
    and immediately display it to the user. However, my work doesn't
    end there. I then utilize JavaScript to hydrate the static HTML.
    This involves attaching event listeners and adding application
    state, effectively transforming the static content into a fully
    interactive web application. üíª [You can check the last article
    about Hydration for more details.](/blogs/hydration)
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Why would one choose to use SSR over other rendering methods?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>
    It significantly improves the initial page load performance. Users
    can view the content almost instantly, as they receive a fully
    rendered page rather than waiting for JavaScript to execute and
    render the content on the client-side.
  </div>
  <div>
    It's also SEO-friendly because search engines can easily crawl and
    index the server-rendered content, leading to better visibility in
    search results. üèÜ
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  Additionally, hydration allows us to maintain the benefits of
  client-side interactivity. By incrementally attaching JavaScript
  behavior to the existing HTML structure, we avoid the need for full
  page reloads, resulting in a seamless and responsive user
  experience.
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Are there any potential drawbacks to this approach?
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="server">
  <div>Yes, there are a few considerations:</div>
  <div>
    Increased server load, especially for complex pages or high
    traffic.
  </div>
  <div>
    More complex development process compared to purely static sites
    or Client Side rendering.
  </div>
  <div>
    Large JavaScript files can make it take longer for your website to
    become interactive.
  </div>
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Is there a way to reduce Time to Interactive (TTI) in this approach?
  It seems like there might be a delay before users can interact with
  the page fully.
</Conversation.Thread>

<Conversation.Thread from="browser">
  <div>Absolutely.</div>

    **Efficient Hydration:** Techniques like [partial
    hydration](/blogs/island-architecture) or [progressive
    hydration](/blogs/progressive-hydration) can be employed. In our
    upcoming articles, we'll delve deeper into partial and progressive
    hydration.

<Conversation.Thread from="user">
  Overall, it seems like SSR with Hydration presents a compelling
  solution for achieving fast initial page loads while maintaining
  dynamic functionality.
</Conversation.Thread>

  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    Precisely. By leveraging the strengths of both server-side and
    client-side rendering, SSR with Hydration provides a powerful
    approach for building high-performance, SEO-friendly web
    applications that deliver an excellent user experience.
