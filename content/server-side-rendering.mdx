Welcome back! Previously, we discussed Static Site Generation. Today, we shift our focus to Server-Side Rendering (SSR), a technique where the server generates the HTML for a page on each request. SSR enhances performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered pages to the client, improving load times and user experience.

  <Conversation.Thread
    message="Sure! SSR with Hydration is an advanced web development technique that combines Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Client-Side Rendering (CSR).  as server I pre-render the HTML for the initial load, and then the client-side JavaScript, handled by Browser, hydrates this HTML to make it interactive."

  <Conversation.Thread
    message="That's right! Once I receive the pre-rendered HTML from Server, I display it immediately. Then, my client-side JavaScript kicks in to attach event listeners and make the static HTML interactive."

    message="In conclusion, SSR with Hydration leverages the advantages of both SSR and CSR. By pre-rendering HTML on the server and hydrating it on the client, you achieve fast initial loads, excellent SEO, and dynamic interactivity. This approach is ideal for complex web applications requiring high performance and great user experience."

We hope you enjoyed learning about Server-Side Rendering. Join us next time as we explore Incremental Site Generation (ISG), a modern approach that combines the benefits of static and dynamic rendering for improved scalability. Goodbye for now, and see you in our next post on Incremental Site Generation!
