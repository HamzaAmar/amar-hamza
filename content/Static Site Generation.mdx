In our last post, we covered Hydration. Today, we'll focus on Static Site Generation (SSG), a technique that pre-renders web pages at build time, resulting in fast and secure static files. SSG combines the best of both worlds by offering the performance of static sites with the ability to fetch dynamic content at build time.

Thank you for joining us in exploring Static Site Generation. In our next post, we'll discuss Server-Side Rendering (SSR), a technique that renders web pages on the server at request time for a dynamic and personalized user experience. Goodbye for now, and see you in our next discussion on Server-Side Rendering!
