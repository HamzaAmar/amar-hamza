In our last post, we explored Multi-Page Applications. Today, we shift our focus to Client-Side Rendering (CSR), where the browser handles rendering the page using JavaScript. CSR provides a dynamic and responsive user experience by updating the UI without requiring a full page reload.

We think this conversational style might be a bit more fun and easier to follow than a regular article. Hopefully, it makes learning about these rendering patterns less boring and more hands-on!

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Hey Chat, I've heard about Client-Side Rendering (CSR). Can you
    explain what it is?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    Of course! In CSR, As a server I deliver a minimal HTML file
    Inside it I add the necessary JavaScript files. I don't generate
    the content; instead, I provide the resources needed for the
    browser to do the rendering.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    And once I receive these files, I take over by executing the
    JavaScript to render the webpage. This means the content is
    dynamically generated and updated on the client side, offering a
    more interactive experience.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Why do we need CSR?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    CSR became popular with the rise of Single-Page Applications
    (SPAs), which offer a more dynamic and interactive user experience
    similar to desktop applications. CSR allows for faster navigation
    and better responsiveness since the page doesn't need to be fully
    reloaded for each user interaction.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    When should I use CSR?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    <div>
      Interactivity is crucial: For applications requiring rich user
      interactions and dynamic content updates without full page
      reloads.
    </div>
    <div>
      Speed in navigation: When fast client-side routing and smooth
    transitions between pages are needed.
    </div>
    <div>
      Separation of client and server logic: When you want a clear
      separation of concerns, with the client handling the UI and the
      server handling data operations.
    </div>
  
  </Conversation.Thread>

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    What are the pros of CSR?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">

<div>
  Enhanced Interactivity: CSR enables highly interactive and dynamic
  user experiences.
</div>
<div>
  Reduced Server Load: Since the client handles the rendering, the
  server can focus on data processing and API responses.
</div>
<div>
  Smooth Navigation: Users can navigate between views without full
  page reloads, providing a smoother experience.
</div>

  </Conversation.Thread>

  <Conversation.Thread from="user">And the cons?</Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
   <div>
      SEO Challenges: Search engines might struggle to index content
    generated dynamically by JavaScript, although modern SEO
    techniques and prerendering can mitigate this.
    </div>
    <div>
      Initial Load Time: The initial load might be slower because I, the
    browser, have to downloads, parses and executes JavaScript before
    rendering the page.
    </div>
    <div>
    Performance Issues: Large JavaScript bundles can delay the First
    Contentful Paint (FCP ) and Time to Interactive (TTI).
    </div>

  </Conversation.Thread>
  
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Can you explain more about these SEO challenges? I'm not sure I
    fully understand.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    Certainly. Search engine crawlers, like Googlebot, primarily index
    content that is immediately available in the HTML source. With
    CSR, much of the content is generated by JavaScript after the
    initial page load, potentially making it invisible to these
    crawlers. This can lead to lower search rankings or even pages not
    being indexed at all.
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    That's concerning. Are there effective ways to address these SEO
    issues?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">
    Yes, absolutely! There are several effective Pattern that can help
    us make Seo Friendly website. We'll delve into those in more
    detail in future articles, so stay tuned!
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Ok, what frameworks or Libraries can I use for CSR?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte etc...
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    How can I improve CSR performance?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="browser">

  <div>
    JavaScript Bundling: Use code splitting and lazy loading to reduce
      the size of initial JavaScript bundles.
  </div>
  <div>
      Preloading Resources: Preload critical resources to improve
      loading times.
  </div>
    
  </Conversation.Thread>
  
  <Conversation.Thread from="user">
    Thanks, Server and Browser! This was really insightful. Any final
    thoughts?
  </Conversation.Thread>
  <Conversation.Thread from="server">
    Client-Side Rendering is a powerful technique for building dynamic
    and interactive web applications. While it offers significant
    advantages in terms of user experience and interactivity, it also
    comes with challenges such as SEO and initial load performance. By
    leveraging modern frameworks and performance optimization
    techniques, developers can harness the full potential of CSR to
    create fast, responsive, and engaging applications.
